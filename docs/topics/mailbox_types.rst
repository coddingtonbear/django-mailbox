Supported Mailbox Types
=======================

Django Mailbox supports polling both common internet mailboxes like POP3 and IMAP as well as local file-based mailboxes.

.. WARNING::
   This will delete any messages it can find in the inbox you specify; 
   do not use an e-mail inbox that you would like to share between applications.


POP3 and IMAP Mailboxes
-----------------------

Mailbox URIs are in the normal URI format::

    protocol://username:password@domain

Basic IMAP Example: ``imap://username:password@server``

Basic POP3 Example: ``pop3://username:password@server``

Most mailboxes these days are SSL-enabled; 
if yours is, add ``+ssl`` to your URI.  
Also, if your username or password include any non-ascii characters,  they should be URL-encoded 
(for example, if your username includes an ``@``, it should be changed to ``%40`` in your URI).

If you have an account named ``youremailaddress@gmail.com`` with a password of ``1234`` on GMail,
which uses a POP3 server of 'pop.gmail.com' and requires SSL, 
you would enter the following as your URI::

    pop3+ssl://youremailaddress%40gmail.com:1234@pop.gmail.com


Local File-based Mailboxes
--------------------------

If you happen to want to consume a file-based mailbox like an Maildir, Mbox, Babyl, MH, or MMDF mailbox, 
you can use this too by entering the appropriate 'protocol' in the URI.  
If you had a maildir, for example, at ``/var/mail/``, you would enter a URI like::

    maildir:///var/mail

Note that there is an additional ``/`` in the above URI after the protocol; 
this is important.
