  Thanks `@ariel17 <https://github.com/ariel17>`_!
* Adds translation support.
  Thanks `@ariel17 <https://github.com/ariel17>`_!
* **Drops support for Python 3.2**.  The fact that only versions of
  Python newer than 3.2 allow unicode literals has convinced me
  that supporting Python 3.2 is probably more trouble than it's worth.
  Please let me know if you were using Python 3.2, and I've left you
  out in the cold; I'm willing to fix Python 3.2 support if it is
  actively used.

  OAuth credentials for gathering messages from gmail.
  Thanks `@alexlovelltroy <https://github.com/alexlovelltroy>`_!

  archive processed e-mails.
  Thanks `@yellowcap <https://github.com/yellowcap>`_!

* Fixes `#13 <https://github.com/coddingtonbear/django-mailbox/issues/13>`_;
  Python 3 support had been broken for some time.  Thanks for catching that,
  `@greendee <https://github.com/greendee>`_!

3.1
---

* Fixes a wide variety of unicode-related errors.

3.0
---

* Restructures message storage such that non-text message attachments
